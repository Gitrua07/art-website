about me: >-
  Hey! 

  My name is Gaia. I love to draw with digital art being my main medium. I created this website as a digital portfolio of artwork I have worked thus far. Also, as a computer science major, I wanted to make a project that also showcased my web development skills. And thus, I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fully code this portfolio website.
